# Employing-class-in-Object-Oriented-Programming-

* Instruction:
You have been asked to develop a system that makes it easier to organize patient data. You will create a class that does the following:

Takes in patient parameters regarding their personal information
Contains methods that allow users to update their information
Gives patients insight into their potential medical fees.

* patient parameters:
sex: patient’s biological identification, 0 for male and 1 for female
bmi: patient BMI
num_of_children: number of children patient has

estimated_cost=250∗age−128∗sex+370∗bmi+425∗num_of_children+24000∗smoker−12500

* Project's tasks:

1/ Creating update_new_info functions:
update_age
update_num_of_children
update_bmi
update_smoking_status

2/ Creating one method that uses a dictionary to store a patient’s information in one convenient variable called patient_profile() 

3/ Using try and except statements to ensure that patient data is uploaded using numerical values in the valid way.
